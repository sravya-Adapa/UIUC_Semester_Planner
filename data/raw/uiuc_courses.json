Students will explore topics including basic machine learning foundations (e.g., linear regression and PCA), adversarial attacks against different learning algorithms, differential privacy, data valuation, and different categories of defenses. The lessons are reinforced via a series of topic-driven lectures, coding assignments, related paper readings, exams and in-class discussions. Students will learn to analyze current interactions between attackers and defenders on machine learning and therefore develop an understanding of the principles on trustworthy machine learning which is an emerging and important topic. Students will be required to finish three related homework projects, including 1) developing a machine learning classifier, 2) designing adversarial attacks against the built classifier, and 3) developing defenses to improve the robustness of the trained classifier against designed attacks.

Model types will include decision trees, linear models, nearest neighbor methods, and others as time permits. We will cover classification and regression using these models, as well as methods needed to handle large datasets. Lastly, we will discuss deep neural networks and other methods at the forefront of machine learning. We situate the course components in the \"data science life cycle\" as part of the larger set of practices in the discovery and communication of scientific findings. The course will include lectures, readings, homework assignments, exams, and a class project. Most of the course activities will use Python with the Pandas library, which students should already be proficient using. Students will learn how to use the scikit-learn Python library for machine learning during this course. Prerequisite: Students should be familiar with the concepts of tabular data (tables) and data types (categorical, ordinal, continuous, etc.) and be able to implement these concepts in Python using Pandas.

This enables developers to show how their envisaged working interactive technology will be used productively in a particular real-life context. Communicating the vision of computational devices is a challenge because dynamic use in context is hard for people other than the device's developers to imagine. The ability to produce convincing, clear, powerful demonstrations even at the early stages of a project is a highly valuable entrepreneurial skill, and also highly applicable within an organization. Directed and supervised investigation of selected topics in information studies that may include among others the social, political, and historical contexts of information creation and dissemination; computers and culture; information policy; community information systems; production, retrieval and evaluation of knowledge; computer-mediated communication. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.

Regression topics include linear regression with recent advances using large numbers of variables, smoothing techniques, additive models, and local regression. Classification topics include linear regression, regularization, logistic regression, discriminant analysis, splines, support vector machines, generalized additive models, naive Bayes, mixture models and nearest neighbor methods as time permits. Lastly we develop neural networks and deep learning techniques, bridging the theory introduced in the earlier parts of the class to purely empirical methods.

Although data mining has its roots in database management, it has grown into a discipline that focuses on algorithm design (to ensure computational feasibility) & statistical modeling (to separate the signal from the noise). It draws heavily upon a variety of other disciplines including statistics, machine learning, operations research, & information retrieval. Will cover the major data mining concepts, principles, & techniques that every information scientist should know about. Lectures will introduce & discuss the major approaches to data mining; computer lab sessions coupled w/assignments will provide hands-on experience with these approaches; term projects offer the opportunity to use data mining in a novel way.

Theories of information can contribute to the scientific foundations for many important research and practice activities in IS, including data curation, information modeling, information access, digital preservation, and informatics support for science and scholarship. This course, Theories of Information -- A, takes a logic-based approach to investigating the nature of information. Methodologically we draw from a family of methods that might be called formal methods, in contrast to the empirical methods of social and nature science. Formal methods typically make use of concepts from logic, set theory, and discrete mathematics to construct and explore formal systems. Formal methods are widely used in linguistics, mathematics, philosophy, and computer science. Within the general area of formal methods our approach in this course might be more specifically referred to as conceptual analysis, as it takes the form of a systematic analysis of a concept, namely information. Most of the prior work that is relevant to our analysis is from analytic philosophy, linguistics (especially formal semantics), and computer science (especially knowledge representation and AI). 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Prerequisite: Some familiarity with formal logic would be useful, but is not required.

            "description": "Cryptography is a powerful toolbox for building secure systems --- not just for private communication, but also for building fault tolerant protocols, for securely outsourcing computation to untrusted services, and more. The goal of this course is to introduce the concepts of modern cryptography, including a combination of theoretical foundations (how do we precisely state security guarantees and assumptions, and prove that a protocol is designed correctly?) and practical techniques (how do we combine secure primitives to make effective systems?). This course is intended for senior undergraduate students with an interest in applying cryptographic techniques to building secure systems, and for graduate students with an interest in cryptography or systems security.
